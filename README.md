# MyReads Project

This is my submission based off [the starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this application is to allow a user to
1. List books that have been placed on one of three book shelves: 
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read 
- Read
2. Move books from one shelf to another shelf by changing the shelf it is associated with, and having the UI render immediately to reflect that change as well as have the backend updated with the change so it is persisted
3. Search for books by title or author from the library via the given `BooksAPI` and either add a Book shown in the results to one of the shelves, or if the book is already on a shelf, to update the shelf the book is on

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
